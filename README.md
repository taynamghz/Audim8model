Audimate – AI-Powered Casting Assistant for the Saudi Film Industry

Description

Audimate is a localized, AI-driven casting assistant built to streamline and modernize the audition process for the Saudi film and television industry. It leverages advanced video and speech analysis to evaluate self-taped auditions, helping directors identify the best talent based on emotional tone, facial expressions, vocal delivery, and character alignment.

Designed with the needs of Saudi productions in mind, Audimate supports Arabic language input and cultural context, integrating local datasets and tools provided by the Saudi Ministry of Media, SADAIA, and the Arabic large language model, Allam.
